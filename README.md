I know i can code.. i can make executable programs.. i have made lot's of small program myself.. and also big projects myself.

Although I can prove that I can code. I wanted to improve myself more.. with programming... I want to make a habit starting today.. that I will commit myself in improving my coding skills.. starting git noob.. This is my first repo by the way..But I have my first commit on a flutter community project by flutterph. I'm new to github and I want to learn more..
