**Todays Progress :** Reprogram

**Thoughts  :** I feel lost in my desktop somehow become really slow version of ubuntu that i have experienced.. tried working efficient in accelerating the emulator.. it takes toll to my progress because i slowed down.. so I look for solutions and stuff to solve the problem but.. i came up with the solution of installation of other linux os system...

**Todays Progress :** Learning from books and docs

**Thoughts :**This time i want to learn from exploring documentation's and from books or articles online.. I feel like there's lot of youtube video now that is tutorial about what 
you want to do.. but learning from watching is different than solving your problem yourself.. i just wan't to practice solving this myway rather than watching the fix to do it..
for me to be a earn that experience i needed to learn that programming language..as of now i want to solve from scratch before i based my learning from youtube..
I'm doing this 100 Days of Coding Challenge..to become a better programmer than i am now.. improve and learn new language..
