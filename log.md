**Todays Progress :** Reprogram

**Thoughts  :** I feel lost in my desktop somehow become really slow version of ubuntu that i have experienced.. tried working efficient in accelerating the emulator.. it takes toll to my progress because i slowed down.. so I look for solutions and stuff to solve the problem but.. i came up with the solution of installation of other linux os system...
I review and installed MANJARO xfce.. i am using it and completing it to perform installation of needed packages and software program i need..
